# Use a print() statement to explain that the number of infections doubles every six days.

# Use time.sleep() to pause a few seconds so the user can read your print() statement.

# Use an input() statement to have the user enter the CURRENT NUMBER OF INFECTED CASES.  Make sure it's an INT.
# Use an input() statement to have the user enter the NUMBER OF DAYS TO SIMULATE.  Make sure it's an INT.

# Use a print() statement to display the current number of infected people and how many days to simulate.

# Remove the comment on the next line and change the two variables to reflect the variable names you used. 
# while VARIABLE FOR DAY NUMBER <= NUMBER OF DAYS TO SIMULATE:
    
    # Write an assignment statement (use =) to double the number of infected people. 
    # Write an assignment statement (use =) to multiply the number of infected people by the mortality rate to find the number of deaths.
    # Write a print() statement that displays the number of infected people and the number of deaths. 
    # Increment the current day number by 6, since the number of infections doubles every six days approximately.  
    # Use time.sleep() to pause for a few seconds to allow the user to read the instructions.  

# Write a print() statement that shows the total number of infections and the number of deaths after running your simulation.
